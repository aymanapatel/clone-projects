### Atom

> Similar to `createSlice` of Redux Toolkit. (`createSlice` = Intial State + Reducer fns + Actions)


- Atoms can be read from and written to from any component. 
- Components that read the value of an atom are implicitly subscribed to that atom, so any atom updates will result in a re-render of all components subscribed to that atom
